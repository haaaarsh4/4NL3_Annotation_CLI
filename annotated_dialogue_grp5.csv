"Well, now I think I might not.",Pam,Harsh

I don't mind if I do.,Pam,Harsh
So what’s your crazy business pipe dream?,Pam,Harsh
"Jim set up a job interview for me today in Philly. It’s um, with a real estate company, which is a great fit for me because I live in a house and I know what a bathroom is. I’m sorry, I am just very nervous because honestly this is all moving a lot faster than I expected. And, and because my resume can fit on a post-it note.",Pam,Harsh
nan,Michael,Harsh

No! No!,Michael,Harsh
Oh God! What?!,Michael,Harsh

"Duuudes, stop.",Meredith,Harsh
"When I was a kid, my grandmother used to make me chocolate cake when I wasn’t feeling good. She’s not around to do that anymore. I’m sorry, I just need a moment to myself just to clear my head.",Michael,Harsh
What are you doing?,Dwight,Harsh
No no no no no no!,Michael,Harsh
"Paranoid? I'm not familiar with the word. And I really don't have time to learn new words right now, ok? A pudgy 22-year-old is trying to take my job.",Michael,Harsh
So maybe we should call. We should call someone. I could help. I’m good with bosses. Call one of the higher-ups?,Michael,Harsh
Say-,Pam,Harsh

We’re called Kevin and the Zits.,Kevin,Harsh
"Oh, yeah. You really shouldn't litter.",Pam,Harsh

I’m out too.,Dwight,Harsh
"Oh, the Nets are super tough.",Jim,Harsh
"Day One. I’m in the interior of the vast Pennsylvania wilderness. I’ve brought with me only the bare essentials. A knife, roll of duct tape, in case I need to craft some shelter or make some sort of water vessel. It’s hot today. The sun is in the two-thirds easterly quadrant, which would make it about 2 o’clock in the afternoon. It’s really beating down on me now. I think that I want to get a little more comfortable because the sun is depleting my resources. OK. OH, there we go. Watch that I don’t hit my corroded artery here…",Michael,Harsh
"Erin, did we win?",Andy,Harsh
Yeah.,Michael,Harsh

Leave!,Dwight,Harsh
"If your woman is like mine, I bet you come home to hear the same thing all the time. This paper is so hard. It scratches. Why can’t there be a paper just for me? Well now there is. ‘Papyr.’ Paper for women. It’s pink, scented and silky soft. Now, you can watch the game and she can write a letter to her sister.",Dwight,Harsh

"No, that was inadvertent. We didn't actually plan that.",Angela,Harsh

I’m going to be dropping out on one of our biggest clients this afternoon and I could use some back up.,Jim,Harsh
"Cage matches? Yeah, they work. How could they not work? If they didn't work, everybody would still be in the cage.",Dwight,Harsh
"The Schrutes are a very loyal breed. But I also have Mannheim blood from my German grandmother. And the Mannheims knew when to cut and run. No sense going down with a losing regime. But the Schrute blood... It's amazing that when these two bloods mix, the whole thing didn't explode.",Dwight,Harsh
Did you pee on a stick?,Pam,Harsh
What does that mean?,Andy,Harsh
OK.,Andy,Harsh

"Ok guys, √Ę‚ā¨Ňďwe all drink them all√Ę‚ā¨¬Ě.",Michael,Harsh
"Hello! How are you? I’m, uh, just about to close on 126 over there and I guess we’re going to be neighbors. Very cool, very cool. So, uh, so what’s the vibe? What’s the vibe of this place?",Jim,Harsh
Exactly!,Pam,Harsh
I know. Now you don't have to.,Angela,Harsh
"You're doing great Michael, look at you go!",Pam,Harsh
I wasn’t here that day.,Pam,Harsh
Sounds great.,Pam,Harsh
You have new music?,Jim,Harsh
Ah. I know. It just feels so empty with so many of the old gang gone.,Michael,Harsh
"There is no greater feeling than when two people who are perfect for each other overcome all obstacles, and find true love. And that is what I thought that Erin and Kevin were going to find today... I think I'm going to be sick...",Michael,Harsh
"How long is this? Oh, Pam. Good work! Oop, wait, stop. Drawings.",Michael,Harsh
You first.,Jim,Harsh

So happy hour.,Pam,Harsh
New York. Wanna go?,Pam,Harsh
"But, what if?",Angela,Harsh
"""Look under the sink in the men's room.""",Dwight,Harsh
Can’t believe they let someone like you serve on a jury. Makes me question the whole judicial system.,Kelly,Harsh
"Okay, everybody! After you walk the runway everyone has to vote for who gets the coupon book. And you can't vote for yourself.",Pam,Harsh
Next stop: Laverne’s Pies Tires Fixed Also.,Michael,Harsh

You know what? Come with me. We are going on a little mission. Operation Surprise.,Jim,Vedant
Why would I love that? Can we afford a delivery guy?,Pam,Vedant
"Coffee is the great incentivizer in the office. It's a drug. It is quite literally a drug that speeds people up. It's not the only drug that speeds people up. You hear stories about Dunder Mifflin in the eighties before everybody knew how bad cocaine was. Guh. Man, did they move paper!",Michael,Vedant
Fail.,Dwight,Vedant
"Michael, you know you don't have to turn us all in. All you need is one scapegoat.",Dwight,Vedant
Here's how I usually handle this: all I do is listen.,Creed,Vedant
Which one is that again?,Pam,Vedant
Kelly made me realize something. She and I have... nothing in common. And I need more friends.,Ryan,Vedant
It should take no time at all if you put the care into it that you normally do.,Phyllis,Vedant
"Nellie, I�m sorry, but I don�t feel comfortable being evaluated by someone I don�t know.",Andy,Vedant

"Yeah, that�s a good one.",Jim,Vedant
I think it should be a surprise.,Phyllis,Vedant
Yeah. You don�t have to ask me.,Angela,Vedant
"OK. If I have to do this, based on stereotypes that are totally untrue, that I do not agree with, you would maybe not be a very good driver.",Michael,Vedant
"I think I'll go to Angela's party, because that's the party I know.",Kevin,Vedant
Nope.,Michael,Vedant

"You should work out Ryan, you would look so hot.",Kelly,Vedant
Andy.,Angela,Vedant
"Well, now OK, I know that this is probably not appropriate, but I need help. Because I want to play ball with my kids before I get too old. And before that happens I need to get laid. And before that happens I need to be in love. And I don't wanna hear ""Ahnnn... I can't help elhh la la."" No. No. I'm a catch and I am not going to be the one who got away. So, this is what we're going to do. Dwight is going to hand out index cards and I want you all to write down the name of an eligible woman for me to date by the end of the day.

What's this?,Toby,Vedant
"Yeah, I didn't go through with the wedding. I got cold feet, a few days before. And I can't really explain it. I just had to get out of that relationship. We still had to pay for all the food.
