"Duuudes, stop.",Meredith,Harsh
"When I was a kid, my grandmother used to make me chocolate cake when I wasn’t feeling good. She’s not around to do that anymore. I’m sorry, I just need a moment to myself just to clear my head.",Michael,Harsh

"Day One. I’m in the interior of the vast Pennsylvania wilderness. I’ve brought with me only the bare essentials. A knife, roll of duct tape, in case I need to craft some shelter or make some sort of water vessel. It’s hot today. The sun is in the two-thirds easterly quadrant, which would make it about 2 o’clock in the afternoon. It’s really beating down on me now. I think that I want to get a little more comfortable because the sun is depleting my resources. OK. OH, there we go. Watch that I don’t hit my corroded artery here…",Michael,Harsh

"No, that was inadvertent. We didn't actually plan that.",Angela,Harsh

"The Schrutes are a very loyal breed. But I also have Mannheim blood from my German grandmother. And the Mannheims knew when to cut and run. No sense going down with a losing regime. But the Schrute blood... It's amazing that when these two bloods mix, the whole thing didn't explode.",Dwight,Harsh

Ah. I know. It just feels so empty with so many of the old gang gone.,Michael,Harsh
